## Intro

It was a Christmas Eve, one of those days that I felt neither inspired nor motivated, just lost in the miserable feeling of self-doubt. :(

Sitting in a nearby cafe, I saw a person writing something at the back of the receipt. Instantly, I realized all I should do was just to keep doing what I was doing.

So I took out my pen and drew **a little story** at the back of my receipt, thinking that maybe one day I'd be able to finish 100 stories in 100 different coffee places all over Tokyo and then stop.

Then the day came but I din't stop. :)
